### Instructions

To start the development server, run:
 `yarn global add parcel-bundler` (use `sudo` if required)
 `yarn start`

For creating a production build:

- Delete the `dist/` directory (optional)
- Run `yarn build`

<hr>

PS: `yarn` can be replaced by `npm` above but prefer `yarn` since it's obviously the superior one.
